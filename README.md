- **Weapon System**: Modularized weapon types and firing logic for easy extensibility and designer-friendly configuration.
- **Player Special Abilities**: Implemented action-oriented combat systems including bullet parry and slash combos.
- **Data-Driven Dialogue System**: Utilized JSON data to load and play dialogues without code changes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. FSM-Based Enemy AI
- Each state (`Enter`, `Update`, `Exit`) is managed as an independent class, making maintenance and adding new states straightforward.
- For bosses, implemented phase transition logic based on HP thresholds to provide complex attack patterns.

### 2. Weapon System
- Designed parameters such as firing mode, bullet speed, and damage to be immediately adjustable within the Unity Inspector.
- Uses a `WeaponBox` placement system, allowing designers to arrange weapons in the scene according to their intent.

### 3. Combat Mechanics
- **Bullet Parry**: A defensive-offensive mechanic that parries projectiles with precise timing.
- **Slash Combo**: A system that determines and executes chained attacks based on input timing.
- **Bio-Energy**: A resource system required for using special abilities.
- **Special Ability**: Enables unique special attacks depending on the currently equipped weapon.

### 4. Dialogue System
- Dialogue content is managed via JSON, allowing non-programmers to edit scripts without touching the code.
- `ChatEventTrigger` fires dialogue sequences at specific locations or conditions within a scene.
