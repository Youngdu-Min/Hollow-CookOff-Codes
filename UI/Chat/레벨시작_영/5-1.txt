HANDLER	I can't believe you broke a monster like that. That was great, HOLLOW.
HANDLER	But the person who just got in on the radio...
VULCAN	I'm late in introducing you. I'm the owner of the FACTORY you're looking for.
HANDLER	VULCAN....
HANDLER	You have not been ordered to kill.
HANDLER	If you don't resist anymore, you'll be able to survive here.
VULCAN	Is that a conciliation?
VULCAN	To make another weapons that you want?
VULCAN	NO, no you can't. I just make what I want to make.
