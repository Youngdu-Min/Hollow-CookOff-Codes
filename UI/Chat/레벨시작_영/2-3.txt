HANDLER	According to the blueprint we secured,<br>there will be an elevator that can reach the center of the FACTORY soon.
HANDLER	The target, VULCAN, is probably hiding most deep in the FACTORY.
HANDLER	Note that VULCAN's personal information has never been exposed so far.
HANDLER	Even the government's intelligence cannot figure out him.<br>even VULCAN's face.
HANDLER	When the business needed, he sends a woman named ELEAOR as his agent.
HANDLER	The only information we have is that it's an elderly man.
HANDLER	Fortunately, I don't think we'll see old men here often.
HANDLER	If you see an old man, please remove the finger from the trigger.
